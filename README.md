### Smart Student Attendance & Engagement Tracking System

**ATTENDSY** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to streamline the attendance process for educational institutions. Leveraging **QR code technology** and **Geo-fencing**, it ensures secure, verifiable, and efficient attendance tracking in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📱 Smart Attendance**: Students mark attendance by scanning a dynamic QR code generated by the teacher.
- **📍 Geo-Fencing**: Validates student location against the teacher's position to prevent remote attendance fraud.
- **⏱️ Real-Time Dashboard**: Teachers can view live attendance updates, engagement metrics, and session status.
- **🔒 Secure Authentication**: Robust login system for both students and teachers using hashed passwords.
- **📊 Engagement Tools**: Features for student feedback and live interaction during sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Custom-designed, responsive UI with a premium "Glassmorphism" aesthetic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic DOM manipulation, Geolocation API integration, and async API handling.

**Backend**
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for efficient, scalable server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: RESTful API framework for handling routes and middleware.
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.

**Database**
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database (hosted on Supabase) for robust data integrity.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (Database Service)
- **Git**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DipayanXD/ATTENDSY.git
cd ATTENDSY
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install dependencies from the root directory.
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Configuration
1.  **Create a PostgreSQL database** (e.g., using Supabase or a local instance).
2.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or ensure `backend/.env` is linked) with the following variables:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?schema=public"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
    PORT=5000
    ```

3.  **Run Schema Migration**:
    Initialize the database tables using the provided SQL script or Prisma.
    *Option A (SQL Script)*: Run the contents of `database/schema_pg.sql` in your SQL query editor.
    *Option B (Prisma)*:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

4.  **Seed Data**:
    Populate the database with test users and courses using the provided SQL data.
    - Run the contents of `database/data.sql` in your SQL query editor.

### 4. Start the Server
Start the backend server from the root directory.
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2.  **Important**: Open `index.html` (or `login.html`) using a **Live Server** (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension).
    - *Why?* Browser Geolocation APIs requiring for attendance features typically require a secure context (HTTPS) or `localhost` serving. Opening the file directly (`file://`) may block location access.
    - URL should look like: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/frontend/index.html`
