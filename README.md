## 🚀 Key Features

- **📱 Smart Attendance**: Students mark attendance by scanning a dynamic QR code generated by the teacher.
- **📍 Geo-Fencing**: Validates student location against the teacher's position to prevent remote attendance fraud.
- **⏱️ Real-Time Dashboard**: Teachers can view live attendance updates, engagement metrics, and session status.
- **🔒 Secure Authentication**: Robust login system for both students and teachers using hashed passwords.
- **📊 Engagement Tools**: (Planned) Features for student feedback and live interaction during sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Custom-designed, responsive UI with a premium "Glassmorphism" aesthetic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic DOM manipulation, Geolocation API integration, and async API handling.

**Backend**
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for efficient, scalable server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: RESTful API framework for handling routes and middleware.

**Database**
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database (via Supabase) for robust data integrity.
- **MySQL**: Legacy support available (configurable via environment variables).

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** (Database Service)
- **Git**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATTENDSY.git
cd ATTENDSY
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Database Configuration
1.  Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Supabase or local pgAdmin).
2.  Run the schema script located in `database/schema_pg.sql` (or `schema.sql` for MySQL) to create the necessary tables.
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    DB_HOST=your_db_host
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASS=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=your_db_name
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5500
    ```

### 4. Seed Data (Optional)
Populate the database with test users and courses.
```bash
npm run seed
```
*Creates default users: `teacher@example.com` and `student@example.com` (Password: `password123`)*

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 6. Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2.  Open `index.html` (or `login.html`) directly in your browser.
    - *Note: For Geolocation features to work correctly, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code "Live Server" extension) to serve the frontend over `http://localhost:5500` or `127.0.0.1`.*
